# Data Science:Hands-on Covid19 Face Mask Detection-CNN&OpenCV
https://www.udemy.com/course/drone-programming-with-python-face-recognition-tracking/


This is a hands-on Data Science guided project on Covid-19 Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts. We will build a Convolutional Neural Network classifier to classify people based on whether they are wearing masks or not and we will make use of OpenCV to detect human faces on the video streams. 

## You will learn:

  - How to detect Face masks on the static images as well as in the video streams.
  - Classify people who are wearing masks or not using deep learning
  - Learn to Build and train a Convolutional neural network
  - Make a prediction on new data using the trained CNN Model

## We will be completing the following tasks:

  - Task 1: Getting Introduced to Google Colab Environment & importing necessary libraries

  - Task 2: Downloading the dataset directly from the Kagge to the Colab environment.

  - Task :3 Data visualization (Image Visualization)

  - Task 4: Data augmentation & Normalization

  - Task 5: Building Convolutional neural network model

  - Task 6: Compiling & Training CNN Model

  - Task 7: Performance evaluation & Testing the model & saving the model for future use

  - Task 8: Make use of the trained model to detect face masks on the static image uploaded from the local system

  - Task 9: Make use of the trained model to detect face masks on the video streams
