# Project Description:

Using Python and some graphing libraries, you can
project the total number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19, and also display the total number of
deaths for a country (this article uses India as an
example) on a given date. Humans sometimes
need help interpreting and processing the meaning
of data, so this article also demonstrates how to
create an animated horizontal bar graph for five
countries, showing the variation of cases by date

# Project Tasks:
  - From epidemic to pandemic
  - COIVID-19 cases in India, China, US,
Italy, and Spain.
  - How the COVID-19 spread over a
period of time with the help of
visualisation.
  - How fast it has spread in India, US
and some other countries using
visualisation tool. 
  - Total number of death over the
period of time in India and other
countries.
  - We will also perform graphical
data analysis using strip plot.
  - Finally we will create the animated
horizontal bar chart/graph for
some countries.
