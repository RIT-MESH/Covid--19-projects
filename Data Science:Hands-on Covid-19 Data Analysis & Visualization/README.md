https://www.udemy.com/course/hands-on-covid-19-data-visualization-using-plotly-express/learn/lecture/22227940#overview

### This is a Practical Hands-on Course hence for the best learning experience we recommend you to type the codes in your own notebook following the lessons carefully. No Unnecessary lectures. No unnecessary details.

But that’s not all:

The same data visualization skills can be used for many other purposes like :

  - Sales Data Visualization

  - Office reports Visualization

  - Any other kind of Visualization

You can Visualize absolutely any kind of data.

# We will complete the following tasks in this hand-on project :

  - Task 1: Importing Libraries

  - Task 2: Importing Datasets

  - Task 3: Data Cleaning

  - Task 4: Bar graphs- Comparisons between COVID infected countries in terms of total cases, total deaths, total recovered & total tests

  - Task 5: Data Visualization through Bubble Charts-Continent Wise

  - Task 6: Data Visualization through Bubble Charts-Country Wise

  - Task 7: Visualizing relationship between Total cases, Total deaths and Total tests

  - Task 8: Advanced Data Visualization- Bar graphs for All top infected Countries

  - Task 9: Advanced Data Visualization- Countries Specific COVID Data Visualization: United States

  - Task 10: Advanced Data Visualization- Countries Specific COVID Data Visualization: India

  - Task 11: Geographical Data Visualization - Choropleth maps Animation- Equi-rectangular projection

  - Task 12: Geographical Data Visualization - Choropleth maps Animation- Orthographic and Natural Earth projection

  - Task 13: Bar animation- Cases growth through Continent

  - Task 14: Text Visualization using WordCloud- Specific reasons for COVID related deaths

  - Task 15: Text Visualization using WordCloud- Generic reasons for COVID related deaths

### We will be using Google Colab as our notebook.
